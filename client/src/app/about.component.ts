    'Finnish oral folklore and mythology.\n' +
    'It is regarded as the national epic of Karelia and Finland and is one of the most significant works ' +
    'of Finnish literature. The Kalevala was ' +
    'instrumental in the development of the Finnish national identity, the intensification of Finland\'s ' +
    'language strife and the growing sense of ' +
    'nationality that ultimately led to Finland\'s independence from Russia in 1917\n' +
    'The first version of The Kalevala (called The Old Kalevala) was published in 1835. The version most ' +
    'commonly known today was first published in 1849 and consists of 22,795 verses, divided into fifty folk stories';
